# Code Description

This data consists of two parts, the first part is mainly the car simulation part that I wrote, and the other part is mainly responsible for the operation of the real radar.



1. Collaborative work_Realistic Lidar files: This is the part that Yanhan and I collaborated on. If you want to have a clearer understanding, you can refer to the LIDAR repository

2. My work_Simulation project: Mainly the simulation experiment I conducted

   ### Attention: All files inside must be started using VMware to run the virtual machine I uploaded.

3. ROS Noetic and ROS 2 Humble and Gazebo: The first virtual machine provided for Autonomous Mobility Robotics, later modified by me, can be used to run my simulation program

   ### Note: This must be started on VMware
