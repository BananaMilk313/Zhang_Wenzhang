# Code Description

This data consists of two parts, the first part is mainly the car simulation part that I wrote, and the other part is mainly responsible for the operation of the real radar.



## car simulation part

It mainly consists of four parts

### Note: All of this code needs to be started in the virtual machine (which I uploaded separately).

1. Old versions: All versions of this program developed, including old versions

2. 9new_start_４——Hit the wall to stop: This is the final simulation project currently under development

   The startup method is to start all files in Matlab and then run main.

3. world: All built worlds for testing purposes

   How to start World see video tutorial.(on Teaching Files)

4. stop: A special mini program is used to stop the car, as it is required for all tests, so it has been placed outside.

5. Teaching Files: This section contains two teaching folders, mainly describing how to open World and how to modify radar parameters.
